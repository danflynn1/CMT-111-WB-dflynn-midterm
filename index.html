                <h1>The role of Zoos in Antiquity and the Modern Era</h1>
                <p>Many of us have fond childhood memories of going to the local zoo with friends and family to visit its inhabitants – inhabitants we may never have the chance to meet otherwise. Perhaps taken for granted, these experience no doubt instill within us a more intimate understanding of the natural world of which we are part. Although some question the ethics of zoos, they nevertheless form an important part of our society. In addition to providing education and enrichment for visitors, most zoos are an integral part of wildlife conservation efforts. They provide services, research, and funding that serve to protect endangered habitats and species. Even though zoos have not always been among humanities most ethical enterprises, today they are fundamental to understanding our place as stewards of Earth’s living beauty.</p><div class="right"><img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="silhouette of tree and head"></div>
                
                <p>Historically, visiting what we now call a ‘zoo,’ would have been a symbol of a lifestyle of extreme luxury only afforded to wealthy monarchs and royalty. Menageries were private collections of wildlife maintained by rulers across the ancient world; from Rome to Tenochtitlan, to the imperial palaces of Western Europe and Russia. It would take until the 19th century for the ‘royal menagerie’ to transform into something we would recognize today. Urbanization led to the creation of the ‘zoological park,’ – the term from which we derive ‘Zoo’ – which would take on new characteristics as a public spectacle and hub of scientific research.</p>

                <p>Around the 1970s following the publishing of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring,” and the environmentalist movement the decade prior, zoos began to rebrand. They would do away with their less-than-ethical practices and restructure around the missions of conservation and education. Some claim that zoos are exploitative and harmful by the very fact they keep animals in captivity. While, that could be true of select establishments, this argument fails to account for the vital function zoos provide to large scale conservation efforts.</p>
                <img src="images/hands.png" alt="logo of hands holding earth">
                <p>Zoos as we think of them today are used to buttress projects being undertaken elsewhere in natural habitats. They provide care and rehabilitation to endangered animals and have the ability to maintain a viable population in the event of threats to a species. Many also assist in research and partner with other organizations to help fund conservation efforts. Other entities go by different names but participate in similar activities. Sanctuaries and larger conservancy parks have the added benefit of providing trails and outdoor space for visitors to integrate with the habitat and wildlife being preserved.</p>
                
                <p>The ability to integrate with nature may be the most vital function of zoos and sanctuaries. Human civilization has profound impacts on the natural world and as Benjamin Parker says, “With great power comes great responsibility.” Citizens of the world need places to experience and be reminded of what’s at stake should we fail to responsibly steward Earth’s ecosystem. When we understand our place in the cosmos it becomes clear how precious and rare life on planet Earth really is, and how unique a position we are to be able to experience it.</p>
